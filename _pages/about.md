I'm Yayati Jadhav, a senior PhD candidate at the Mechanical and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (MAIL) at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). My research specializes in Deep Generative Models for Accelerated Mechanical Design and Manufacturing. I integrate advanced machine learning techniques to create surrogate models for accurate property prediction, enabling faster and more efficient product design cycles. Additionally, my work involves the inverse design of complex mechanical structures, optimizing their performance by predicting optimal configurations. Furthermore, I develop large language model (LLM)-based agent workflows that enhance real-time monitoring and intelligent control systems in manufacturing processes, aiming to significantly boost efficiency, reduce costs, and ensure superior quality in production environments.
